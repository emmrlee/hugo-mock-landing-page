# User Stories for StyleThief

This is a backlog of user stories for StyleThief, an idea for a chrome extension tool that allows users to copy fonts, colors, and CSS snippets from websites directly from their browser.

## Illustrated Features

1. As a graphic designer, I want to easily extract the exact font styles that are used on various websites I admire, so I can incorporate the same fonts into my own designs without having to go through the process of guessing and checking the font family, sizing, or styling.
2. As a front-end developer, I want to collect and export CSS snippets and stylesheets while browsing, so I can easily integrate them into my development workflow and prototypes.
3. As a small business owner, I want to analyze colors from successful competitor websites in my industry, so I can redesign my website using similar colors to better align with market trends and customer preferences.


## Other Features

1. As a design team lead, I want the extension to facilitate the sharing of collected design assets and inspiration boards with my team members, so we can collaborate effectively and maintain consistency in our design projects.
2. As a user, I want to use StyleThief directly from my browser, so I donâ€™t have to download a desktop app and interrupt my workflow by switching between different windows.
3. As a web accessibility advocate, I want the extension to include an Accessibility Checker feature that evaluates websites for compliance with accessibility standards, so I can ensure that the websites I visit and design prioritize inclusivity for users with disabilities.
4. As a novice designer, I want the extension to suggest complementary font pairings based on the font styles extracted from websites, so I can create visually appealing typography for my designs without extensive knowledge of typography principles.
5. As a UI designer, I want the extension to include a color palette generator that automatically generates color palettes based on the colors I extract from websites, so I can quickly pick color schemes for my designs.

## Potential Features Expansion

1. As a design tool developer, I want to integrate the extension with prototyping tools such as Sketch and Figma, so users can directly import collected design assets and styles into their design projects seamlessly.
2. As a design trend analyst, I want to analyze and report on emerging design trends and patterns based on data collected from popular websites using the extension, so I can provide insights to design industry professionals and stakeholders.
3. As a user, I want to use the extension on resources beyond websites seen through my browser (i.e. .pdf, .docx, etc.), so I can just upload files from my computer and take the fonts and colors from there.
4. As a UX/UI designer, I want the extension to implement a Hoverable Analyzer feature, so I can analyze font styles and color choices in real time as I browse websites, letting me quickly assess design elements and gather inspiration without leaving my browsing tab.
5. As a market researcher, I want the extension to analyze competitor websites and suggest similar websites based on their font styles and color palettes so that I can gather comprehensive data for industry trend analysis.
6. As a design enthusiast, I want the extension to provide a personalized feed of design inspiration based on the fonts, colors, and design styles I've collected, so I can stay updated on the latest design trends and find inspiration for my own projects.
7. As a design researcher, I want the extension to include a Design History Tracker that lets me pick websites to watch and logs the changes in design elements (such as fonts, colors, and layout) on the websites over time, so I can better track the evolution of design trends and patterns.
