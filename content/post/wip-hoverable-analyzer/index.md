The team at StyleThief is working hard to bring you a new way to "steal" inspiration design assets from your favorite websites.

With the Hoverable Analyzer, you will soon be able to  simply hover over any font, color, or element on a webpage, and instantly reveal detailed information about its styling. Whether you're seeking inspiration or assessing design elements, the Hoverable Analyzer empowers you to gather insights and spark creativity in the blink of an eye.
